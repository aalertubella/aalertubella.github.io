## About

I am a Senior Research Engineer at [Umeå University](https://www.umu.se/en/) in the [Responsible AI](https://www.umu.se/en/research/groups/responsible-artificial-intelligence/) group.

My research areas include logic and proof theory (in particular [deep inference](http://alessio.guglielmi.name/res/cos/index.html)). I am interested  in the design of formalisms and systems, as well as in applications of logic for intelligent systems.

Previously, I was a postdoc at [IRIF](https://www.irif.fr//en/index) (Univ. Paris Diderot).

I obtained a PhD from the University of Bath under the supervision of [Alessio Guglielmi][Alessio]. Before that, I did a MASt in Mathematics at the University of Cambridge (part iii of the mathematical tripos), and even before that I studied an undergraduate in Mathematics at the University of Barcelona.

You can reach me at andrea dot aler at umu dot se . You can find me in room D418, 4th floor of MIT-huset in Umeå University.
