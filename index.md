# About

I am a postdoc at Umeå University. I work with Virginia Dignum in a WASP project focused on the formal verification of ethical principles of AI systems.

My research areas include logic and proof theory (in particular deep inference). I am interested  in the design of formalisms and systems, as well as in applications of logic in intelligent systems.

Previously, I was a postdoc at IRIF (Univ. Paris Diderot).

I obtained a PhD from the University of Bath under the supervision of Alessio Guglielmi. Before that, I did a MASt in Mathematics at the University of Cambridge (part iii of the mathematical tripos), and even before that I studied an undergraduate in Mathematics at the University of Barcelona.

You can reach me at andrea dot aler at umu dot se . You can find me in room D418, 4th floor of MIT-huset in Umeå University.
